You shouldn't need to download any data to complete the homework (unless you want to use one of the images we used from class. In that case, the data can be found in the GIT repository under the \"data\" directory. If you are not using the GIT repository directly on your machine, it is very easy to set up and the best way to have access to all the class material. In order to copy our class repository to your machine you can follow these simple commands:\n",
